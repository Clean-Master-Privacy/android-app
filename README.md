# Clean Master Privacy

About Clean Master Privacy
--------------------------
Clean Master Privacy is a powerful toolkit that protects your Android devices from viruses, theft, and other threats.

Clean Master Privacy is one of the best antivirus solutions available for Android devices. This threat engine is highly regarded in the industry and has been used and developed for over 15 years. In addition to identifying malicious apps, it can scan memory and SD cards. When it finds a threat, it can root, sandbox, and eliminate it.

You can set the app to run on a schedule, so it protects your device without thinking. Scans are also available on-demand, and the program automatically updates threat definitions. In addition to protecting you from viruses and other malware, it protects you while you browse the web, hides chats and other private conversations, and has a find my phone feature.

In fact, Clean Master Privacy is packed with smart features. For example, if someone tries to access your device and enters the wrong password or gesture, it takes a selfie of them. You can even set it to notify you immediately via email or another device if such an intrusion occurs or your device moves when it shouldn’t.

There’s not much negative to say about Clean Master Privacy. It requires Android 5.0 or later, and it’s a shame that such a good app doesn’t work on devices that only support older versions. It’s also a shame that certain features are limited to certain devices. For example, fingerprint lock only works on Samsung Galaxy series devices.
